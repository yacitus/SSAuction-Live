# SSAuction-Live

## TODO:

* HEADER!

* figure out how to dedupe team_live/bids.html.heex and auction_live/bids.html.heex
* Teams Table on auction page: hide Time Nominations Expire and New Nominations Open At columns if there are no unused nominations
* make Rostered Players table on team & auction pages sortable, add column for datetime rostered
* Auto-Nomination Queue page: show Nominations Per Team
* Auto-Nomination Queue page: highlight top N players where N = Nominations Per Team
* allow teams of the same name, as long as they're not in the same auction
